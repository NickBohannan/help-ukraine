Even before the conflict escalated this week, there were already 400,000 children there who needed humanitarian aid.

That's why Save the Children has made their own [Ukraine Crisis Relief Fund](https://support.savethechildren.org/site/Donation2?df_id=5751&mfc_pref=T&5751.donation=form1) to help Ukrainian families now.

# Humanitarian Aid
### Official Fundraising Account for Humanitarian Assistance to Ukrainians Affected by Russia’s Aggression
The account is meant for charity contributions from Ukraine and from abroad. The Ministry of Social Policy will channel the raised funds to support Ukraine’s citizens severely affected by the war.

“Russian aggression deprived thousands of Ukrainians of their home, money, clothes, food, and other basic things. However, Ukraine and the rest of the world would not leave them alone with their grief. Financial support keeps coming both from the citizens of our country and from abroad. To streamline the inflows of funds as humanitarian aid to Ukrainians affected by the war, the NBU has opened an account for the Ministry of Social Policy to accumulate charitable contributions for social needs in wartime. Unlike the special account that has been opened to finance the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, money from this account will be used to help those hardest-hit by the war with Russia,” - said the NBU Governor Kyrylo Shevchenko.

Money transferred to this account will be used by the Ministry of Social Policy:

-   to provide food and shelter for refugees and citizens that have been displaced due to military conflict
-   to provide clothing, shoes, and medicine for them
-   to buy staple goods for the population
-   to pay out one-off financial aid and to meet other essential needs of the population.

Account details of the Ministry of Social Policy are below: UA823000010000032302338301027.

This account accepts multiple currencies. It has been established and opened to receive transfers from international partners and donors both in foreign currency (U.S. dollars, euros, British pounds) and from Ukrainian business and citizens in hryvnias.

If necessary, the NBU will update the payment details for charitable assistance for humanitarian purposes.

Support Ukraine, help Ukrainians!

### Canada-Ukraine Foundation
[Gofundme page](https://www.gofundme.com/f/helpukrainenow-ukraine-humanitarian-appeal)
[Official CUF Website](http://www.cufoundation.ca)
Last week, Russia declared war on Ukraine. The Russian army has attacked military facilities, infrastructure and civilian targets. The WHO health cluster estimates that the number of affected people has climbed from 2.9 million a week ago, to over 18 million today.

The Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal, established by the Ukrainian Canadian Congress (UCC) and the Canada-Ukraine Foundation (CUF) is working with Ukrainian government ministries, who are in the best position to advise on the needs on the ground so that we can ensure that the donations we receive meet the needs of the Ukrainian people.

The UCC-CUF Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal has already deployed approximately $500,000 CAD to provide food packages, medicine and shelter. Subsequent tranches of support will follow as we monitor delivery and needs.

“As of 9:00 am EST on February 28, the Appeal has raised over $4 million from a broad base of supporters across Canada – provincial governments, family foundations, community organizations, credit unions, public and private companies, and thousands of individual donors,” said Orest Sklierenko, President and CEO of CUF. “I am overwhelmed by the outpouring of support from every corner of Canada, who share the horror of the war being waged by Russia against the Ukrainian people.”

“We are extremely grateful to all Canadians for their continued generosity and support at this time of need,” said Alexandra Chyczij, President of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress. “Putin must be held to account in the International Criminal Court of Justice where he should be tried for war crimes.”

Please donate to the appeal today to support millions of Ukrainian families who have been displaced from their homes. #HelpUkraineNow.
